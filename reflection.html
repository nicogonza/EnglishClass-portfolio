								<h3>Nico Gonzalez</h3>
								<p>English 2116 has taught me a lot about technical writing. At the very beginning I was surprised that I was going to be writing about ghosts and demons in a class. I thought this was pointless and I was not going to get much out of it. Looking back now, I’ve realized that writing about on an unusual subject actually allowed me to worry more about the structure than the content. Since all the situations were hypothetical, I was free to write whatever came to my mind and then structure it in a correct technical way. For example, in the bad/good news letter I choose how to say yes or no to the request. I wasn’t really worried about what to say but more of how to say it. The correspondence project allowed us to actually attempt to persuade another group member to want a partnership with us. Again since the actual content was hypothetical It was easy to come up with reasons why they should join a partnership. But what truly matter wasn’t the reasons for the partnership but rather how the documented was structured and if my writing style was able to persuade that other member. The humor within the class allowed us to connect to our classmate and group members. It was a great way to merge a daunting task like a technical document and make it fun. It also provided us the opportunity to read the different ways our peers would react to the same situation in a business setting and learn from them. My favorite part of this class this semester was the group project. The group project basically allowed us to compile a rather complex technical document by merging the creative ideas of everyone in the group. In the end we have a document that could be used for a proposal but it was a funny way of learning and compiling such document. The group I had the pleasure of working with also helped make this one of my favorite assignments. When you can communicate and solve issues with your teammates you create a connection and trust. For example for the infographic we had an issue with the annotated bibliography where due to personal circumstance’s a group member was not able to complete their part on time. Instead of simply not completing this part we jumped in and took over that persons role in order to complete the infographic and turn it in on time.
