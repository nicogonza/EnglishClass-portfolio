									<p>This portfolio contains some of the work that I have worked on for the technial writting class 2116 at
                                        UNCC. All
										of the files are viweable and can be downloaded. I decided to build my own website as I am a 
                                        computer science
										student and with todays frameworks it doesnt take much longer than using sites like weebly but it 
                                        gives me a lot more control over how the website looks and how the end user can interact with it 
                                        without being 
                                        restricted by only for prmemium users feutures offered in sites that build the website for

									<h3>Chapter 7 excerise</h3>
                                    <button class="button" onclick="insertText('chp7','chp7')">Prompt</button>
                                    <p>I like this assignment because it allowed me to address an issue that any manager is likely to encounter in the work place. It dealt with handling a situation where one co-worker felt uncomfortable in a situation and was asking for a tradition to be changed in order to make her comfortable attesting the dinners.

									<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
									<button class="button" onclick="insertText('chp7','chp7')">Prompt</button>	
                                    <p>I like this exercise because it allowed us to compare and contrast the difference between target audience. It shows a clear example in which a flyer containing almost the same information and with the same intended purpose will change based on who will be reading the information. </p><div id="chp2" style="visibility: hidden;"></div>

									<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
                                    <button class="button" onclick="insertText('chp7','chp7')">Prompt</button>
                                    <p>This assignment was interesting because it allowed us to look into the website grants.org and look over what a grant proposal would include. I didn’t know how much work went into a grant proposal until I had to do this assignment.

									<h3>Instructional memo</h3>
                                    <button class="button" onclick="insertText('chp7','chp7')">Prompt</button>
                                    <p>For this assignment we were asked to provide a instructional memo to explain in detail how a procedure should be done. Since the memo was associated with out group project I based mine off how to properly prepare for a body burial. The target audience for this memo was every employee at Bobby’s singer salvage yard that could potentially be doing a body burial. The writing is focused on steps as I think it is easier to follow a list of steps than it is to read a paragraph and figure out what needs to be done. Also by listing all the steps a user can go back and re read a step easier that if it was all combined into paragraphs.</p>

									<h3>Bad News Letter</h3>
                                    <button class="button" onclick="insertText('chp7','chp7')">Prompt</button>
                                    <p>We were asked to respond to the prompt that was an email of a client. This was the response in which we had to tell the client bad news. The purpose of this assignment was to properly address and respond to a letter providing news that we know the other person is not expecting to hear. I followed the advise to present the news somewhere in the letter without making it the main point.

									<h3>Good News Letter</h3>
                                    <button class="button" onclick="insertText('chp7','chp7')">Prompt</button>
                                    <p>Based on the same prompt as the bad news assignment, we were asked to respond to the same inquiry but in a positive ‘good news’ way. Since the audience was the same but the context of the response changed, it was a good way to practice the different ways to respond to letter in a different attitude and voice.</p>

									<h3>Correspondance Project- Proposal</h3>
                                     <button class="button" onclick="insertText('chp7','chp7')">Prompt</button>
                                    <p>This assignment had two parts. The proposal and the response. For the first part, I wrote a proposal to Nimbus racing Broom, another group in the class, asking them to start a business partnership. In this assignment we had to try to pusuade or inform the person we were emailing that starting a partnership with us would be beneficial for them. I started by introducing the company I work for and then actual proposing the partnership. I closed off the proposal by letting them know why I think this would be beneficial and with contact information.
