                            <p>This portfolio contains some of the work that I have worked on for the technical writing class 2116 at UNCC. All of the files are viewable and can be downloaded. I decided to build my own website as I am a computer science student. Instead of using sites like weebly building my own website gives me a lot more control over how the website looks and how the end user can interact with it without being restricted by paid futures. However, I could have spent a lot less time on this assignment had I just used weebly.

                            <p>I like this assignment because it allowed me to address an issue that any employee could face one day. The purpose of this assignment was to try to handle a situation in the workplace. The situation was that we felt uncomfortable having work meetings at a specific restaurant and were asking for a tradition to be changed in order for to be able to attend the meetings comfortably. I choose to write the memo by explaining the benefits of changing the tradition in the long run since the company is growing. I concluded the memo by making a suggestion of how the situation could be addressed.

                            <button class="button" onclick="insertText('chapter2_prompt','chp2')">Prompt</button>
                            <p>The purpose of this assignment was to compare to different flyers that contained the same information but presented it in a different way. I liked this exercise because it allowed us to compare and contrast the difference between target audience. It shows a clear example in which a flyer containing almost the same information and with the same intended purpose will change based on who will be reading the information. My writing style was very focused at pointing out the differences in the flyers and how those would change my attitude and acceptance of the information based on the setting.</p>

                            <p>
                                This assignment was interesting because it allowed us to look into the website www.grants.org and look over what a grant proposal would include. I didn’t know how much work went into a grant proposal until I had to do this assignment. The purpose of the assignment was to look at a technical document and try to find what information we needed to submit the proposal. I wrote this memo by simply providing the information that was required in a structured way such that any employee would be able to get started on the grant proposal.

                            <button class="button" onclick="insertText('insmemo_prompt','memo')">Prompt</button>
                            <p>For this assignment we were asked to provide an instructional memo to explain in detail how a procedure should be done. Since the memo was associated with out group project, I based mine off how to properly prepare for a body burial. The target audience for this memo was every employee at Bobby’s singer salvage yard that could potentially be doing a body burial. The writing is focused on steps as I think it is easier to follow than it is to read a paragraph and figure out what needs to be done. Also by listing all the steps a user can go back and re-read a step easier that if it was all combined into paragraphs. </p>

                            <button class="button" onclick="insertText('gnl_prompt','bnl')">Prompt</button>
                            <p>We were asked to respond to the prompt that was an email of a client. This was the response in which we had to tell the client bad news. The purpose of this assignment was to properly address and respond to a letter providing news that we know the other person is not expecting to hear. I followed the advice to present the news somewhere in the letter without making it the main point.

                            <button class="button" onclick="insertText('gnl_prompt','gnl')">Prompt</button>
                            <p>Based on the same prompt as the bad news assignment, we were asked to respond to the same inquiry but in a positive ‘good news’ way. Since the audience was the same but the context of the response changed, it was a good way to practice the different ways to respond to a letter in a different attitude and voice. This exercise also showed me how the different writing styles can make even bad news seem better than they really are.

                            <p>This assignment had two parts. The proposal and the response. For the first part, I wrote a proposal to Nimbus racing Broom, another group in the class, asking them to start a business partnership. In this assignment we had to try to pusuade or inform the person we were emailing that starting a partnership with us would be beneficial for them. I started by introducing the company I work for and then actual proposing the partnership. I closed off the proposal by letting them know why I think this would be beneficial and with contact information. </p>

                            <p>The purpose of this assignment was to come up with an infographic. As a group we decided to do a comparison on angles vs daemons based on the show Supernatural. Fortunately, we didn’t have any major conflicts working on this assignment. I was assigned to put the infographic together while others were assigned to find the images as well as the sources and information to use for the infographic. The only conflict we had was trying to finish the annotated bibliography as one of our group members was not able to complete it on time but we worked around it.</p>
